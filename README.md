## Requirements
- Python
- [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)

## Usage

Manim-DS provides a simple to use Command Line Interface. To use it run the `run.py` file directly.

The library can also be used to write custom animations based on Data Structures.

The output file generated using default interface is stored in `...\manim-ds\media\videos\interface\1080p60\`


## Examples

- Stack Example With Overflow and Underflow Handling. Can take in Numbers, Letters as well as Special Charcters.

- Binary Search Tree Example. Takes only Intgers as Input.

## TODO
This is  a work in progress with more features to come.
This currently only has Stack and Binary Search tree, but I wish to add other Data Structres with more features as well.
